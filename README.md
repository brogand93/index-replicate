# index-replicate

index-replicate allows you to replicate an index ETF. It allows you to create a custom index to use as the basis of a stock portfolio. 

This form of do-it-yourself indexing is pointless for many of you reading this. Buying VOO (S&P 500) or VT (total US market) will give you similar results with much less headache.

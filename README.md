# index-replicate

index-replicate allows you to replicate an index ETF. It allows you to create a custom index to use as the basis of a stock portfolio. 

This form of do-it-yourself indexing is pointless for many people. It's going to be a lot simpler to simply invest in an ETF that tracks the index you wish to track. However, if you are a resident of EU this may not be possible without signifigant tax hurdles getting in your way.

This small CLI aims to get a close approximation of a chosen index (or percentage of an index) at the previous trading day's closing prices for a given amount of money.
